# Student Directory 2 #

The Student Directory script allows you to manage the list of students enrolled at
Villians Academy.

This is a practice tutorial, creating a command line app,
to highlight the Ruby code that is needed along with teaching the process
of creating a project from scratch.

Student Directory was my first attempt at a command line app, a task set by Makers Academy in week 4 of the Precourse.
Exercises have been committed into the exercises file. These exercises were included on the repository as further practice
and learning tasks. 

In addition, as this was the first tutorial (with exercises in the middle and end), I chose to start the tutorial again
for learning purposes. Please look to Student-Directory-2 for the tutorial without exercises.

## How to use ##

```shell
ruby directory.rb 
```

To load data from students.csv file:

```shell
ruby directory.rb students.csv
````
